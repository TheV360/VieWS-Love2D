fix the cha-cha slide:
	- click in one window,
	- drag the mouse out the boundary of that window
	- directly onto a button
	- that button gets a mouseClick event
	- when it should get a mouse event and maybe a mouseDown
	
mouseDown
- triggered when mouse enters a thing
- & the thing hasn't yet recieved a mouseDown event

mouseClick
- triggered when the mouse is already over a thing and just clicked

this'll need me to make big changes to the "views" object, which really makes me want to switch languages right now lol.


okay i'm writing in this again. i guess.

new todo:
- allow apps to accept cli parameters
- apps need to have a self that they can write to.
	- this'd mean that the app window handle would be a field in the object.
	- it'd make stateful apps 20x easier to make

function app(self)
	self.data = { hi = 5 }
	self.data.window = newWindow(funny)
end
